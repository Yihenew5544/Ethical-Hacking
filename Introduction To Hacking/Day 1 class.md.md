## Hacking üíª 
- is the act of identifying and then exploiting **vulnerable**(**weakness**) in a computer *system* or *network*.
- Usually, to gain unauthorized access to *personal* or *organizational data*.
- Hacking is not always a **malicious** activity, but the term has mostly negative connotations due its association with cybercrime.
## Types Of Hacking
### Based on ==Ethics==
#### Black Hat Hackers
- **Black hat hackers** are the "*bad guys*" of the hacking scene. 
- They go out of their way to discover **vulnerabilities** in computer systems and software to exploit them for *financial gain* or for *more malicious purposes*.
#### White Hat Hackers
- **White hat hackers** can be seen as the ‚Äú*good guys*‚Äù who attempt to prevent the success of black hat hackers through¬†proactive hacking. 
- They use their technical skills to break into systems to ***assess*** and ***test** the level of¬†network security*, also known as¬†**ethical hacking**. 
- This helps expose vulnerabilities in systems before *black hat hackers* can **detect** and **exploit** them.¬†
#### Grey Hat Hackers
- **Grey hat hackers** sit somewhere between the *good* and the *bad guys*. 
- Unlike **black hat hackers**, they attempt to violate standards and principles but without intending to do harm or gain financially. 
- Their actions are typically *carried out for the common good*. 
**For example**, they may exploit a vulnerability to raise awareness that it exists, but unlike white hat hackers, they do so publicly. This alerts malicious actors to the existence of the vulnerability.
### Based on ==Skill==
#### Newbie / Noob
- **Newbie** peoples are *don't have any knowledge for hacking*.
#### Script Kiddie
- is a **relatively** unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purpose.
#### Hacker
- **Hacker** peoples are *perfectly skilled*, with ***less experience***.
#### Elite/ Pro Hacker
- They are *perfectly skilled*, with ***much more experience***.
## Elements of Information Security
### Confidentiality
- When protecting information, we want to be able to **restrict access** to those who are *allowed to see it*; everyone else should be disallowed from learning anything about its contents.
**For example**, federal law requires that universities restrict access to private student information. The university must be sure that only those who are authorized have access to view the grade records.
### Integrity
- **Integrity** is the assurance that the information being *accessed has not been altered* and *truly represents what is intended*. 
- Just as a person with integrity means what he or she says and can be trusted to consistently represent the truth, information integrity means information truly represents its intended meaning. 
- Information can *lose its integrity through* ***malicious intent***, such as when someone who is not authorized makes a change to intentionally misrepresent something. 
**An example** of this would be when a hacker is hired to go into the university‚Äôs system and change a grade.
### Availability
- **Availability** is the third part of the ***CIA triad***.¬†
- **Availability**¬†means that information can be *accessed* and *modified by anyone* authorized to do so in an appropriate timeframe. Depending on the type of information,¬†_appropriate timeframe_¬†can mean different things. 
**For example**, a stock trader needs information to be available immediately, while a sales person may be happy to get sales numbers for the day in a report the next morning. Companies such as Amazon.com will require their servers to be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Other companies may not suffer if their web servers are down for a few minutes once in a while.
## Phases Of Hacking
### 1. Reconnaissance
Before performing any penetration tests, *hackers footprint the system* and ***gather as much information as possible***. 
- **Reconnaissance** is a preparatory phase where the hacker documents the organization‚Äôs request, finds the system‚Äôs valuable configuration and login information and probes the networks. 
- This information is **crucial** to performing the attacks and includes: *naming conventions*, *services on the network*, *servers handling workloads in the network*, *IP addresses*, *names* and *login credentials of users connected to the network*.
### 2. Scanning
- the ethical hacker begins testing the *networks* and *machines* to **identify potential attack surfaces**. 
- This involves gathering information on all *machines*, *users*, and *services* within the network using automated scanning tools.
- Penetration testing typically undertakes three types of scans: *network Mapping*, *port scanning*, *vulnerability Scanning*.
### 3. Gaining Access
Once ethical hackers expose vulnerabilities through the process‚Äôs **first** and **second hacking phases**, they now attempt to *exploit them for administrative access*. 
- This phase involves attempting to **send a malicious payload** to the application through the *network*, an *adjacent subnetwork*, or *physically* using a connected computer. 
- Hackers typically use many hacking tools and techniques to simulate attempted unauthorized access, including: *buffer overflows*, *phishing, Injection Attacks*, *XML External Entity Attacks*, *using components with known vulnerabilities*.
### 4. Maintaining Access
- This hacking process involves processes to ensure the hacker can access the application for *future use*.
- A **white-hat hacker** continuously exploits the system for *further vulnerabilities* and *escalates privileges* to understand how much control attackers can gain once they pass security clearance. 
- Some attackers may also **try to hide** their identity by *removing the evidence of an attack* and *installing a backdoor for future access*.
### 5. Clearing Tracks
- To *avoid any evidence* that leads back to their **malicious activity**, hackers perform tasks that erase all traces of their actions. 
- These include: *uninstalling scripts/applications used to carry out attacks*, *modifying registry values*, *clearing logs* and *deleting folders created during the attack*.
## Penetration Testing
- Is a method of evaluating the **security of an information system** or **network** by simulating an attack to *find vulnerability*, *security measures*, *documentation* and *report presentation*.
### Types Of Pen-testing
The amount of information shared prior to an engagement can have a huge influence on its outcomes. Testing style is usually defined as either:
#### White box penetration testing
- Sometimes referred to as **crystal** or **oblique box pen testing**, involves sharing full *network* and *system information* with the **tester**, including *network maps* and *credentials*. 
- This helps to *save time* and *reduce* the **overall cost of an engagement**.
#### Black box penetration testing
- In a black box penetration test, **no information** is provided to the tester at all. The pen tester in this instance follows the approach of an *unprivileged attacker*, from ***initial access*** and ***execution through to exploitation***. 
- This scenario can be seen as the most authentic, demonstrating how an adversary with *no inside knowledge* would **target** and **compromise** an organization.
#### Grey box penetration testing
- In a grey box penetration test, also known as a **translucent box test**, only limited information is *shared* with the tester. 
- ***Usually this takes the form of login credentials***. 
- Grey box testing is useful to help understand the *level of access a privileged user* could *gain* and the* potential damage* they could cause. 
## Terms
### Red Team
- They are ‚Äú**ethical hackers**‚Äù who help test an *organization's defenses by identifying vulnerabilities* and *launching attacks in a controlled environment*. 
- Additionally, They are **opposed by defenders** called ***blue teams***, and both parties work together to provide a comprehensive picture of organizational security readiness.
### Blue Team
- A **red team** plays the role of the *attacker by trying to find vulnerabilities* and *break through cybersecurity defenses*. 
- A blue team¬†**defends against attacks and responds to incidents when they occur**.
### Vulnerability Assessment
- These are peoples, ***who do some security check based on some list***.
### Security Audit
- A **comprehensive evaluation** of an organization's security *controls*, *policies*, and *procedures*.
